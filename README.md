Sleep Tracker

"Pitch:
Not everyone needs 8 hours of sleep, but how do you know if you’re someone lucky enough to need only 6? Or an unlucky one that needs 10?! Enter Sleep Tracker.

MVP: 
Onboarding process for a user. 
Homepage view shows a graph of your nightly hours of sleep over time .
Ability to create a night’s sleep entry. For each date set (1/1/19-1/2/19), user can scroll through a digital clock image (like when you set your alarm on your phone, or just type in) to enter what time they got in bed and what time they woke up. From this data, app will calculate their total time in bed.
Ability to edit or delete a sleep entry.
Ability to click one of four emoji buttons to rate how they felt right when they woke up, how they felt during the day, and how tired they felt when they went to bed. Behind the scenes, a score 1-4 is given for each emoji. The app will calculate an average mood score for 1/2/19, and compare it to the time spent in bed. The app will then recommend after using for >1 month how much sleep you need.  “Your mood score tends to be highest when you sleep 7.5 hours”
Stretch: Connect the app to a movement tracking device to automatically track when user is asleep.
